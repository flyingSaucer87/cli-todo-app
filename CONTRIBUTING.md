## üéÉ Hacktoberfest Guidelines

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ZERO TOLERANCE FOR SPAM

**This repository participates in Hacktoberfest, but we take spam very seriously.**

We follow [Hacktoberfest's quality standards](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#spam). PRs that do not add meaningful value will be:
- Marked as `invalid` or `spam`
- Closed immediately
- Reported to Hacktoberfest organizers if necessary

### ‚ùå Examples of SPAM PRs (will be rejected):

1. **Trivial/Cosmetic Changes**:
   - Fixing typos in comments or code without substantial value
   - Whitespace-only changes
   - Reformatting existing code without reason
   - Adding/removing blank lines
   - Changing quotes from single to double (or vice versa) without purpose

2. **Low-Effort Contributions**:
   - Adding your name to a contributors list without actual contribution
   - Creating simple/obvious issues just to close them with a PR
   - Copy-pasting code from Stack Overflow without understanding
   - Automated or script-generated PRs
   - Adding unnecessary comments or console.log statements

3. **Duplicate or Invalid Work**:
   - Submitting the same PR multiple times
   - Working on an issue already assigned to someone else
   - Ignoring existing issue discussions
   - Creating PRs without addressing an actual issue

4. **Disruptive Behavior**:
   - Opening multiple PRs for the same change
   - Arguing with maintainers about PR rejections
   - Rushing maintainers for reviews
   - Creating issues just for the sake of creating them

### ‚úÖ What We WANT:

- **Meaningful bug fixes** with clear explanations and test cases
- **Well-documented new features** that solve real problems
- **Performance improvements** with benchmarks showing impact
- **Test coverage additions** that improve code reliability
- **Documentation enhancements** that make the project easier to understand
- **Accessibility improvements** that make the tool more inclusive
- **Refactoring** that genuinely improves code quality and maintainability

## üöÄ How Can I Contribute?

### 1. Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates.

**A good bug report includes**:
- **Clear title** describing the issue
- **Detailed description** of the problem
- **Steps to reproduce** (be specific!)
- **Expected behavior** vs. **actual behavior**
- **Environment details**: OS, Node.js/Python version, etc.
- **Screenshots** (if applicable)
- **Error messages** (full stack trace if available)

### 2. Suggesting Features

We love new ideas! Before suggesting a feature:
- Check if it's already been suggested
- Make sure it aligns with project goals
- Provide clear use cases

**A good feature request includes**:
- **Problem statement**: What problem does this solve?
- **Proposed solution**: How would it work?
- **Alternatives considered**: What other approaches did you think about?
- **Additional context**: Mockups, examples, etc.

### 3. Contributing Code

**Before you start coding**:
1. üîç **Check existing issues** - Look for `good first issue`, `help wanted`, or `hacktoberfest` labels
2. üí¨ **Comment on the issue** - Let us know you want to work on it (include your GitHub username)
3. ‚è≥ **Wait for assignment** - A maintainer will assign it to you
4. üç¥ **Fork the repo** - Create your own copy
5. üåø **Create a branch** - Use a descriptive name (e.g., `fix/issue-42-empty-task-crash`)

---

## üìè Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- **Write clean, readable code** - Code is read more than it's written
- **Follow existing style** - Match the style of the file you're editing
- **Comment complex logic** - But don't over-comment obvious code
- **Keep functions small** - Each function should do one thing well
- **Use meaningful names** - Variables and functions should be self-documenting

---

## üö´ What NOT to Contribute

To maintain quality and respect everyone's time:

### ‚ùå Don't Submit

1. **Trivial Changes**:
   - Whitespace-only modifications
   - Renaming variables without improving clarity
   - Changing formatting without discussing first

2. **Out of Scope**:
   - Features that fundamentally change the project's purpose
   - Massive refactors without prior discussion
   - Adding heavy dependencies without justification

3. **Incomplete Work**:
   - PRs that are "work in progress" without discussion
   - Partially implemented features
   - Broken code that doesn't work

4. **Style-Only Changes**:
   - Unless you're adding a linter/formatter project-wide
   - Must be discussed in an issue first

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Discuss First

For these contributions, **open an issue for discussion** before coding:
- Major architectural changes
- Adding new dependencies
- Breaking changes to existing APIs
- Large-scale refactoring
- New command additions
